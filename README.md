Greetings, everyone! I am Ismail Abousalem, and this repository stands as a curated collection for my upcoming projects. I intend to methodically enhance and expand this portfolio with each new endeavor, aiming for continual improvement and innovation.

Here is a demo video for my Nextcloud app, NextAD!: https://youtu.be/qCNzKnsJnFU?si=1aUhlrz4zs6appaH

In this team project, we developed a Nextcloud-based solution for seamless Active Directory integration, focusing on real-time synchronization to reduce update latency. My role involved creating API endpoints for efficient data exchange, enhancing user attribute updates, and developing interactive features in Nextcloud. Additionally, I contributed to the interface design using CSS and JavaScript, improving user interaction and accessibility, and participated in developing remote Active Directory attribute modification features to enable effective off-site management.

My survival RPG is still in early development, so as of now I do not have a demo video for that project
